#RocketShip PHP Framework

---

RocketShip is a web framework that makes developing web sites and web applications in record time. The documentation will be available soon.

### Why does the code say it's version 1.0.0? 
---
It is 1.0.0 under the name RocketShip, but it's actually the 8th version of this framework (only the name as changed).

### When should i use RocketShip
---
Basically anytime you need to code something without the framework getting in your way too much. If you need MySQL, don't ask, i'm not going to add it to RocketShip. RocketShip only supports [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/).

### Documentation
---

The documentation is included in `docs`. The api documentation is in `docs/api`. It is also available at [rocketship-framework.org](http://rocketship-framework.org)
