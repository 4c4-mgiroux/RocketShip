#RocketShip PHP Framework

---

#### THIS PROJECT WILL NEVER BE UPDATED MORE THAN MINOR BUG FIXES, IT HAS BEEN DROPPED

RocketShip is a web framework that makes developing web sites and web applications in record time. The documentation will be available soon.

### When should i use RocketShip
---
Basically anytime you need to code something without the framework getting in your way too much. If you need MySQL, don't ask, i'm not going to add it to RocketShip. RocketShip only supports [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/).

### Documentation
---

The documentation is included in `docs`. The api documentation is in `docs/api`. It is also available at [rocketship-framework.org](http://rocketship-framework.org)
